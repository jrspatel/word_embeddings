Text embeddings are essential for projects relying on textual context, as computers interpret data as numbers. This project explores converting textual information into machine-readable language using techniques like "TF-IDF," "One-Hot Encoding," "GloVe," and "BERT." Here, I implemented the "Word2Vec" model.
